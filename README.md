# Multilingual-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-RAG-System
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to answer questions.The system uses a PDF of the story, extracts the text, chunks it, creates embeddings, and then uses a generative model to answer user questions based on the retrieved context.
